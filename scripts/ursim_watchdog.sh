#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ursim_watchdog.sh — keep external_control.urp PLAYING on URSim during agent runs.
#
# WHY: a jam during an assembly attempt triggers a protective stop, which halts
# the external_control program. The UR driver then keeps ACCEPTING trajectory
# goals that never execute (12.5s timeouts for every caller) while /joint_states
# stays live — a silent motion-dead sim. Observed twice on 2026-06-11; the replay
# remedy is safe mid-run (verified: a live P2 run continued with its commit floor
# intact after start_external).
#
# WHAT: poll the dashboard programState every INTERVAL seconds; on "stopped":
#   - real faults (EMERGENCY/FAULT/VIOLATION) are logged and left alone,
#   - a protective stop is cleared (close safety popup + unlock),
#   - the program is replayed via start_external (load -> play -> confirm),
#   - every event is timestamped in $LOG.
# URSim down / dashboard unreachable => stay quiet (nothing to guard).
#
# Runs as the ursim-watchdog systemd user service (Restart=always).
