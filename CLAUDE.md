# CLAUDE.md — isaac-sim-mcp runtime & operations

Project memory for agents working in this repo. Captures the **verified** way to launch Isaac Sim
with an extension, the ROS domain rule, and the **open ROS2-driver gap** that currently blocks
fully-automated robot motion. Extend the TODO section as the driver-spawn method is figured out —
the goal is to drive it from isaac-sim-mcp itself.

## What this repo is

MCP server (`isaac_mcp/server.py`) + Isaac Sim Kit extensions (`exts/`) exposing robot digital twins
over the Model Context Protocol. The MCP server connects over a socket to an extension running inside
a live Isaac Sim; each extension is the source of truth for its own tools via `MCP_TOOL_REGISTRY`.

## Extensions

| Extension    | Branch     | MCP port | Robot                    | Module        |
|--------------|------------|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| `ur5e-dt`    | `main`     | 8766     | UR5e + RG2 gripper       | `ur5e_dt`     |
| `soarm101-dt`| `so-arm101`| 8767     | SO-ARM101 (5-DOF + grip) | `so_arm101_dt`|
| `aic-dt`     | `aic`      | 8768     | UR5e + RG2 + cable (AIC) | `aic_dt`      |

`ur5e-dt` (this `main` branch) is the twin the `mode2_*_fmb*_sim` ablations run against.

## Launching Isaac Sim — verified working 2026-05-27 (ur5e-dt)

**0. Cache health FIRST.** `~/.cache/ov/DerivedDataCache` must be **> 50 MB** or `quick_start` wedges
at `load_robot/reset_async` (cold-cooking the robot USD is broken on 5.x). Check / restore:
```bash
~/env_isaaclab/bin/python ~/Documents/isaac-sim-mcp/scripts/prime_usd_cache.py status
# if < 50 MB:  prime_usd_cache.py restore known-good
```

**1. Launch (blocks until the MCP socket is ready, ~5–10 s warm / ~90 s cold):**
```bash
bash -c 'source ~/env_isaaclab/bin/activate; export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=7 DISPLAY=:0; \
  bash ~/.claude/skills/isaac-sim-extension-dev/scripts/isaacsim_launch.sh launch ur5e-dt'
```
Lifecycle helper also supports `status` / `close` / `kill` / `restart <ext-id>` / `wait [timeout] [port]`.
Raw equivalent: `~/env_isaaclab/bin/isaacsim --ext-folder ~/Documents/isaac-sim-mcp/exts --enable ur5e-dt`

**2. Sanity-check the socket** (returns the tool registry):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/isaac-sim-extension-dev/scripts/mcp_test.py 8766 list_available_tools
```

## ROS domain rule (important)

Set `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` **identically** on the sim launch AND on every ROS-side client (the
`mcp-client-example` process and the `ros-mcp-server` it spawns) — they must share a domain to see
each other's topics. We use **`7`** for sim isolation (no real UR5e on domain 0 by default). The
specific number doesn't matter; consistency does.

## DDS rule (RMW + ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY) — the sibling of the domain rule

Same domain is necessary but **not sufficient**. Every ROS node sharing the domain must also agree on
the **DDS vendor** and **`ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY`**, or discovery goes one-way. Symptom we hit (2026-05-27):
`move_home(mode='sim')` failed with *"UR robot driver isn't running"* while `control_gripper(mode='sim')`
"worked". Root cause: the UR driver was launched with the shell default `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0` + FastDDS,
but the consumer (`ros-mcp-server`) **and Isaac** pin `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1` + CycloneDDS +
`cyclonedds_local.xml`. A plain topic *publish* (gripper → Isaac, same profile) survives a mismatched
peer; the consumer→driver direction (`FollowJointTrajectory` **action discovery** + the `/joint_states`
subscription `move_home` needs) never matches, so `wait_for_server()` times out.

Proven empirically (daemon-free rclpy `ActionClient`): `cyclone+localhost1+profile` on **both** sides →
server found; any mismatch → not found. `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY` is the decisive knob (cross-vendor discovery
itself works once it matches). **rmw_cyclonedds gotcha:** `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1` only auto-injects a
loopback discovery config when you have **not** set `CYCLONEDDS_URI`; if both are set, your URI wins and
must itself permit localhost discovery — ours does (it's the same profile the consumer uses).

**Fix — `config/ros_dds.env`** (sourced by `sim_bringup.sh` in `source_ros()` and the driver's launch
shell): exports `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`, `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1`, `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`, and
`CYCLONEDDS_URI` → `config/cyclonedds.xml` (a self-contained mirror of the consumer's profile). This makes
the whole sim ROS stack homogeneous. Keep it in sync with the consumer (`mcp_config*.json` env +
`server_mode2.py` `os.environ.setdefault`). Also: `cmd_up_sim` now runs `ros2 daemon stop` before its
readiness gates — a stale `ros2` CLI daemon from a prior call under a different RMW/domain caches a corrupt
graph and makes `ros2 topic echo /joint_states` see nothing even when the topic is live.

Verified 2026-05-27: with the driver brought up via the patched `sim_bringup.sh`, `move_home(mode='sim')`
returns `{"result": "success"}` (trajectory sent → accepted → completed) under the consumer's exact env.

## Loading a scene (MCP tools on ur5e-dt)

`quick_start()` → `add_objects(assembly='fmb1'|'fmb2'|'fmb3')` → `setup_pose_publisher()` →
`randomize_object_poses()`. Also: `new_stage()`, `assemble_objects(assembly=…)`,
`save_scene_state(json_file_path=…)`/`restore_scene_state(…)`, recording tools. The `mode2_*` ablation
`onStart` hooks call these, so a study self-loads its scene once the sim+extension are up.

## Two ways to bring up the UR driver half of the sim stack

The robot-motion tools need the **UR ros2_control driver** running (it publishes `/joint_states`,
which Isaac's ur5e-dt subscribes to and mirrors onto `/World/UR5e`, and it accepts
`FollowJointTrajectory` on `scaled_joint_trajectory_controller`). Two interchangeable paths — both
end at the same controllers/topics:

- **Fake (mock) hardware — `scripts/launch_ur_fake.sh` (lightweight, no Docker, no `~/ros2_ws`).**
  Uses the apt `ur_robot_driver` with `use_fake_hardware:=true`; the controllers run without URSim
  or a real robot. Best default for a quick twin. `up` / `status` / `down`; sources `config/ros_dds.env`
  so it shares Isaac's DDS island (Cyclone + localhost-only + domain 7). Verified 2026-06-17 on
  `en4226769-l`: commanded a trajectory → `/joint_states` followed → the Isaac `/World/UR5e`
  articulation mirrored it (`[0.8,-1.19,1.00,-0.50,0,0]`). Fresh-install recipe (apt + a4500
  source-build parity, pinned commits):  `~/Desktop/fresh-install-docs/ur_robot_driver-fake-hardware.md`.
  Modeled on a4500 `~/Documents/prismatic-manipulation/scripts/launch_ur.sh`.
- **URSim docker — `scripts/sim_bringup.sh` (heavier; needs Docker + a `~/ros2_ws` `ur_bringup` install).**
  Use when you need URSim-specific behavior (dashboard/program state/PolyScope parity). On a box with
  no `~/ros2_ws` (e.g. `en4226769-l`) the URSim *container* still comes up but the `ur_bringup` launch
  can't — use the fake-hardware path there.

### URSim docker path — verified 2026-05-27

Hands-free, no-browser bring-up of the **UR robot driver** half of the sim stack (the `docker run
ursim …` + `ros2 launch ur_bringup ur5e.launch.py …` steps that previously required clicking through
PolyScope at `:6080`). One command:

```bash
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=7 bash ~/Documents/isaac-sim-mcp/scripts/sim_bringup.sh up   sim  # bring sim stack up
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=7 bash ~/Documents/isaac-sim-mcp/scripts/sim_bringup.sh status sim # check state
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=7 bash ~/Documents/isaac-sim-mcp/scripts/sim_bringup.sh down sim   # tear down + reap
```

The 2nd arg is **mode**: `sim` (default, URSim docker — fully wired) or `real` (lab UR5e —
**intentionally disabled**: `up real` prints the lab sequence [`ur_bringup` @ 192.168.1.111 +
`onrobot_ros gripper_control` + `aruco_camera_localizer localize`] and refuses unless `FORCE_REAL=1`,
so we never ship an unverified robot-motion path; enable + verify in-lab).

Also exposed as an **MCP tool on ur5e-dt**: `start_ros_driver(mode='sim', action='up'|'down'|'status')`
— shells out to this script (blocks ≤240s until ready, under the 300s socket timeout; runs in the MCP
worker thread, touches no USD). So `run.start` / any MCP client can bring the driver up in one call.
**Verified live 2026-05-27** (client → socket 8766 → `_cmd_start_ros_driver` → driver ready, ~5s warm).

⚠️ **Gotcha (baked into the handler):** the subprocess runs with a **sanitized env** (only HOME / USER /
PATH / ROS_DOMAIN_ID). Isaac Sim's process carries its own ROS2 + `env_isaaclab` setup
(AMENT_PREFIX_PATH / PYTHONPATH / LD_LIBRARY_PATH / RMW_*); inheriting it makes the script's
`ros2 topic echo`/`ros2 launch` misbehave (false "no /joint_states"), which previously made the script
reap the healthy driver. Clean env → the script's own `source /opt/ros/humble` + ros2_ws is authoritative.
`launch_driver` also now **fast-fails** instead of silently reaping a running-but-unhealthy driver.

On success `/joint_states` is live and the driver logs *"Robot connected to reverse interface. Ready
to receive control commands."* Verified across a full cold up→down→up cycle on host **EN4226768**
(ur5e, URSim 5.25.1, ROS Humble); host-agnostic — needs Docker + the UR `~/ros2_ws` install.

**Why a custom script (the key insight).** `ros-mcp-server/utils/ursim_cli.py` drives the dashboard
via the driver's *ROS2 services*, which only exist **after** `ros2 launch` — chicken-and-egg. But the
UR **Dashboard Server (TCP 29999) is part of URSim itself**, reachable the moment the container boots.
So `scripts/ur_dashboard.py` speaks the dashboard wire protocol directly (no ROS), powering the robot
on *before* the driver exists. **Order matters and is the whole trick:**

1. start URSim container (`ros2 run ur_client_library start_ursim.sh -m ur5e -d`) → dashboard `:29999` up
2. stage `resources/ursim/external_control.urp` into the mounted programs dir
3. dashboard: power on + brake release → robot `RUNNING` (re-issued as a state machine; a fresh URSim
   silently drops an early `power on`)
4. launch `ur_bringup` → its script-sender starts listening → `/joint_states` flows
5. dashboard: `load` + `play` external_control.urp → External Control connects back → ready

Playing the program **before** the driver listens makes the URCap fail and stop the program — that's
why step 5 follows step 4. Default URSim has no remote-control gate, so dashboard commands work even
with `is in remote control: false` (the `LOCAL_MODE_BLOCKED` issue in `ursim_cli.py` is real-robot-only).

**Gotchas baked into the script:** the UR control node can hang/crash in its
`ScaledJointTrajectoryController` destructor on SIGINT, so `down` polls then escalates SIGINT→TERM→KILL
(headless node, no X11 — KILL is safe) and confirms death. If `up` finds a driver running but
`/joint_states` not live it **fast-fails** (tells you to `down` first) rather than silently reaping a
possibly-healthy driver. Process matching keys on the binary path `/ur_ros2_control_node` to avoid
matching unrelated shells. Config via env: `MODEL ROBOT_IP DASH_HOST ROS_DOMAIN_ID CONTAINER`
(defaults ur5e / 192.168.56.101 / 127.0.0.1 / 7 / ursim).

## Sim prerequisites for robot-motion tools (the driver was the only real gap)

For the **robot-motion** tools (consumed via `ros-mcp-server` `move_home`/`move_to_grasp`/
`control_gripper`/`translate_object`/`rotate_object`, all `mode='sim'`) to work, the **ROS2 robot
driver + the object-pose publisher must be running** and visible on the active `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`.

**Both are now accounted for in the automated pipeline:**
- **UR driver** — bring up with `scripts/sim_bringup.sh` / the `start_ros_driver` MCP tool (above).
- **Object-pose publisher** — the mode2 ablation YAMLs call `isaac-sim__setup_pose_publisher()` in
  **every phase's `onStart`**, right after `add_objects(...)` (objects must exist first) and before the
  `@wait:1` → `assemble_objects`/`randomize_object_poses`. It is *not* folded into `quick_start` on
  purpose — `quick_start` runs before `add_objects`, so the pose graph would be built on an empty
  `/World/Objects`. So the publisher is automated for ablations; it's only a manual step when you
  hand-drive the sim outside a run (call `setup_pose_publisher()` yourself after `add_objects`).

**Observed 2026-05-27** (mode2_anthropic_fmb1_sim via the mcp-client CLI): the assembly phase failed
with *"UR robot driver not running"* and *"cannot access object poses from `/objects_poses_sim`"*. The
pose error was a **downstream symptom of the driver being down** (the same `onStart` runs
`move_home(mode='sim')` at step 4, which needs the driver) — not a missing `setup_pose_publisher` call.
If `/objects_poses_sim` is ever dark *with* the driver up, it's a runtime issue: the **timeline must be
playing** (OmniGraph only ticks on play) and Isaac must be on the **same `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`** as the
consumer.

**Current state:** with Isaac Sim + ur5e-dt up and the driver up via `start_ros_driver`/`sim_bringup.sh`,
the full mode2 pipeline (incl. the pose publisher, via `onStart`) runs hands-free. The driver was the
single remaining blocker for unattended sim data collection, and it is now closed.

### Status — sim bring-up automation

1. ~~**UR-driver bring-up**~~ ✅ done — `scripts/sim_bringup.sh` + `ur_dashboard.py` (see bring-up
   section). `/joint_states` + command interface, hands-free.
2. ~~**Object-pose publisher automation**~~ ✅ already automated — the mode2 YAMLs call
   `setup_pose_publisher()` in every phase's `onStart` after `add_objects`. Not a code gap; deliberately
   not in `quick_start` (ordering). Only manual when hand-driving the sim outside a run.
3. ~~**Drive the driver from MCP**~~ ✅ done + live-verified — `start_ros_driver` tool on `ur5e-dt`
   (registry + `_cmd_start_ros_driver`; `up`→`status` round-trip over socket 8766).

**Net:** unattended sim data collection is unblocked. Bring the driver up once (terminal:
`sim_bringup.sh up sim`, or MCP: `start_ros_driver(mode='sim')`) before `run.start`; the run itself
handles everything else (incl. the pose publisher) via the mode2 `onStart` hooks.

## Downstream consumer — the mode2 ablation pipeline

`~/Documents/mcp-client-example` (separate repo, see its CLAUDE.md) drives ablations against this sim
through two MCP servers: **`isaac-sim`** (this repo's `isaac_mcp/server.py` → ur5e-dt socket 8766) and
**`ros-mcp-server`** (robot motion in sim mode). Its ablation run engine (`src/ablation-runner.ts`) is
driveable headlessly via the agent action **`run.start`** (`MCP_CLIENT_AGENT_API=1`). Once the ROS2
driver gap above is closed, `run.start` + this launch workflow = unattended end-to-end data collection.

## 2026-05-28 — sim/real parity + physics fixes (verified end-to-end)

Full FMB1 sim assembly now works: ground-truth replay seats 4/4, and a live 3-phase ablation
(claude-haiku-4-5) completed all 3 phases on attempt 1 (4/4 assembled), no escalation. Fixes
in THIS repo (consumer-side fixes live in ros-mcp-server):

- **Launch via `scripts/launch_sim.sh`** (NOT the bare skill launcher). It sources
  `config/ros_dds.env` (CycloneDDS + ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1 + domain 7) so Isaac shares the DDS
  island with ros-mcp-server + the UR driver. A bare launch defaults to localhost_only=0 → the
  consumer can't discover /gripper_width_sim, /objects_poses_sim, /joint_states. (commit 0445657)
- **`config/ros_dds.env` + `config/cyclonedds.xml`**: canonical sim DDS env (mirrors the
  consumer profile); also sourced by `scripts/sim_bringup.sh` for the driver. (a2b776b)
- **`add_objects` rebuilds PhysX tensor views** (async `_cmd_add_objects` → stop+play after
  adding objects). Adding rigid bodies to a PLAYING sim invalidates the simulationView → parts
  slip out of the gripper mid-motion. Stop+play re-registers them. (0445657)
- **`ROBOT_BASE_Z = 0.0`** — Isaac convention: ground plane + robot base both at z=0. Do NOT
  raise it; the consumer (ros-mcp-server) is mode-aware to match this in sim. (c545bde)
