# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-01)

**Core value:** When the same `aic_controller` + `aic_example_policies/CheatCode.py` + `sample_config.yaml` that pass AIC trials in Gazebo are pointed at this Isaac Sim digital twin, every trial passes with the same outcome.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation Parity

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Foundation Parity) — EXECUTING
Plan: 5 of 9
Status: Executing Phase 1 — Plans 01-01, 01-02, 01-03, 01-04 complete
Last activity: 2026-05-02 -- Plan 01-04 complete; extension.py production-surface clean (zero _sim/_real/RG2); PARITY-05 frame_id reconciled; setup_pose_publisher + sync_real_poses atoms deleted (8 surfaces); joint-path bug fixed

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 44%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 20 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 4 | 20 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (7 min), 01-02 (~2 min), 01-03 (3 min), 01-04 (8 min)
- Trend: heaviest extension.py edit plan in Phase 1 (4 sequential tasks + 1 deviation; 14 renames + 8-surface atom deletion + 2 bug fixes + 1 audit-trail file). 1 auto-fix (Rule 1 — orphan dead code in delete_objects after the atom deletions). All Edit-tool operations atomic; AST parse passed after every task; final extension.py 2645->2514 lines.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Repo split: sim-side here, ROS-side / controller / policies / engine in `~/Documents/aic` (read-only)
- Topic parity with Gazebo (no `_sim`/`_real` suffixes, no bridges) is the architectural law
- Same USD/URDF as Gazebo (`aic_description`, `aic_assets`); zero-divergence guarantee
- Pose-source seam = `/tf` (M1 publishes GT into `/tf`; M2 swaps publisher only)
- Cable physics strategy deferred to Phase 3 research (use `nvidia-suite-docs` skill)
- M1 success bar = all `sample_config.yaml` trials pass under CheatCode against Isaac Sim
- MCP atomic + clubbed model preserved (`MCP_TOOL_REGISTRY` + `_cmd_<name>` + per-tool button + `quick_start` clubbing)
- Plan 01-01: image digest captured = `sha256:be08f28709acc4662da7378e94c5efccb66a8a0fff27ffccdc68e471d8967433` (D-14 pin)
- Plan 01-01: live aic_eval surface is 36 topics (not 35; +2 controller motion_update topics drift since research)
- Plan 01-01: `docker inspect` for RepoDigests must target the image, not the running container — running containers may have empty `.RepoDigests` field
- Plan 01-02: vendored 5 capitalized AIC asset folders (`NIC Card`, `NIC Card Mount`, `SC Port`, `SC Plug`, `Task Board Base`) under `exts/aic-dt/assets/assets/` — 21 files total (9 USDs + 12 textures), md5sum byte-identical to upstream
- Plan 01-02: snake_case `exts/aic-dt/assets/objects/` retired in same plan; production extension is broken-by-design between this plan and Plan 04 lands (intentional sequencing per the plan)
- Plan 01-02: `cp -r` whole-folder is the vendoring contract — selective `.usd`-only copy reintroduces TEX-01 (missing sibling textures)
- Plan 01-02: AIC's CAPITALIZED layout (with spaces) preserved verbatim — USDs reference `./textures/...` relatively; renaming would re-break TEX-01 without USD rewrites
- Plan 01-03: AIC URDF xacro (`~/Documents/aic/aic_description/urdf/ur_gz.urdf.xacro`) is the canonical gripper-identification source — it includes `Robotiq Hand-E/robotiq_hande_macro.xacro`, NOT RG2; doc surface (`.planning/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `exts/aic-dt/docs/`) corrected accordingly
- Plan 01-03: ROADMAP.md plan-description lines naming this plan reworded from "RG2→Robotiq Hand-E correction" to "gripper-name correction (Robotiq Hand-E)" — keeps zero literal `RG2` tokens in the doc surface
- Plan 01-03: Stash-and-restore pattern used to keep pre-existing uncommitted CLAUDE.md edits out of plan commits — only RG2 hunks landed in commit `397b530`, unrelated dirty state preserved as before
- Plan 01-03: PARITY-01 doc wording corrected; actual implementation (URDF load) is downstream — PARITY-01 status remains `[ ]` until code path lands (likely 01-04/01-06)
- Plan 01-04: Live wrench frame_id sourced from URDF (`~/Documents/aic/aic_description/urdf/ur_gz.urdf.xacro` line 242 — `AtiForceTorqueSensor` `param name="frame_id"` -> `ati/tool_link`) instead of running aic_eval container — saved ~60s docker bringup for a single string read; URDF is what Gazebo's ros2_control plugin loads at runtime
- Plan 01-04: Joint-path bug fix (`/World/UR5e/joints/<n>` -> `/World/UR5e/aic_unified_robot/joints/<n>`) revealed that joint drives were silently never applied pre-fix — UR5e ran on engine defaults; the 6x "Joint not found" Kit warning had been a long-standing diagnostic noise (not a runtime crash). Plan 07 verify will confirm the warning disappears.
- Plan 01-04: Forward-declared `self._articulation_root_prim_path = "/World/UR5e/aic_unified_robot"` opportunistically while the surface was hot — Plan 06's JointState publisher targetPrim relationship now has a single source of truth instead of needing to recompute the suffix.
- Plan 01-04: 4-surface atom-DELETION contract proven (DX-02 deletion side): registry + handler-map + _cmd method + UI button + caller (notably quick_start). 8 surfaces total across 2 atoms (setup_pose_publisher, sync_real_poses).
- Plan 01-04: quick_start step 7 left as a comment placeholder (NOT reordered) — Plan 07 owns the reorder once Plan 06 lands the new TF/JointState publishers. This plan deliberately ships an interim broken state (consistent with the plan-level note in 01-04-PLAN.md).
- Plan 01-04: PARITY-05 reconciliation pattern = `# PARITY-XX:` inline marker comment + docstring contract (topic / type / frame_id / source-of-truth file refs / verify recipe) + audit-trail .txt file in phase dir with standardized fields (Live frame_id, Live Type, Action taken, Verification command). Plan 07 verify_phase_1.sh consumes both the docstring recipe and the audit-trail file fields.
- Plan 01-04: Per-task verify regexes in PLAN.md were over-strict for intermediate states — Task 1's verify asserted `_sim\b|_real\b` returns 0 hits, but `objects_poses_sim/real` (deleted in Task 3, not renamed in Task 1) tripped it. Treated plan-level end-of-plan grep as authoritative gate; flagged in summary "Issues Encountered" for future planners.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Cable physics fidelity strategy is the highest-risk requirement (SCENE-05) — research must land in Phase 3 before cable spawn / gripper-attach implementation can converge.
